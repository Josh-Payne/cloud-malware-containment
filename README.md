# Hyperledger-based Cloud Malware Containment Prototype

Hyperledger implementation of a cloud malware management system.

Installation requirements include Docker, hyperledger fabric, hyperledger composer, node.js, and yeoman.

First set up the hyperledger fabric and get the network up and running using the commands in this tutorial: https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/v0.19/tutorials/developer-tutorial.html

Many of the files there are already present, so some steps may be skipped.

Currently, the model file (org.example.biznet.cto) is in the "models" directory, and the logic file (logic.js) is in the "lib" directory. 

The app is hosted on localhost:4200 once the network is running, exposed to localhost via $ composer-rest-server, and the accompanying angular app is started via $ npm start. More info about setup is in the video.
